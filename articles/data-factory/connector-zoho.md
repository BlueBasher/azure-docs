# Copy data from Zoho using Azure Data Factory (Beta)

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from Zoho. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to version 2 of Data Factory, which is currently in preview. If you are using version 1 of the Data Factory service, which is generally available (GA), see [Copy Activity in V1](v1/data-factory-data-movement-activities.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This connector is currently in Beta. You can try it out and give us feedback. Do not use it in production environments.

## Supported capabilities

You can copy data from Zoho to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Azure Data Factory provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started-2](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started-2.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Zoho connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Zoho linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **Zoho** | Yes |
| endpoint | The endpoint of the Zoho server (`crm.zoho.com/crm/private`). | Yes |
| accessToken | The access token for Zoho authentication. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| useEncryptedEndpoints | Specifies whether the data source endpoints are encrypted using HTTPS. The default value is true.  | No |
| useHostVerification | Specifies whether to require the host name in the server's certificate to match the host name of the server when connecting over SSL. The default value is true.  | No |
| usePeerVerification | Specifies whether to verify the identity of the server when connecting over SSL. The default value is true.  | No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "ZohoLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Zoho",
        "typeProperties": {
            "endpoint" : "crm.zoho.com/crm/private",
            "accessToken": {
                 "type": "SecureString",
                 "value": "<accessToken>"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Zoho dataset.

To copy data from Zoho, set the type property of the dataset to **ZohoObject**. There is no additional type-specific property in this type of dataset.

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "ZohoDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "ZohoObject",
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Zoho linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Zoho source.

### ZohoSource as source

To copy data from Zoho, set the source type in the copy activity to **ZohoSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **ZohoSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM Accounts"`. | Yes |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromZoho",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Zoho input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "ZohoSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM Accounts"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```
